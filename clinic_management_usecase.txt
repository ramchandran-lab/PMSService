Business Use Case 1: Outpatient Clinic Management System

Business Context

Dr. Sharma runs a multi-specialty outpatient clinic with 5 doctors (General Physician, Pediatrician,
Gynecologist, Orthopedic, Dermatologist) in a growing urban area. Currently, the clinic uses a paper-
based system with a receptionist manually managing appointments in a register, doctors writing prescriptions by hand, and billing done through a basic calculator and receipt book.

This manual process leads to double-bookings, long patient wait times, lost medical records, difficulty in tracking patient history, and challenges in generating financial reports for business planning.

The clinic needs a digital practice management system to streamline patient registration, appointment scheduling, consultation workflow, prescription management, and billing operations.

Business Objectives

Reduce patient wait time by 40% through better appointment scheduling
Eliminate double-bookings and scheduling conflicts
Maintain digital medical records for all patients
Enable doctors to access patient history during consultations
Automate billing and generate financial reports
Improve patient satisfaction through better communication
Track doctor performance and clinic revenue


Target Users

Receptionist/Front Desk - Patient registration, appointment booking, billing
Doctor - View appointments, patient history, write prescriptions, consultation notes
Patient - Book appointments, view medical history, download prescriptions
Clinic Admin - User management, clinic configuration, reports and analytics

Business Logic - Key Calculations

Available Slot Generation

Doctor Schedule: Monday-Friday, 9:00 AM - 5:00 PMLunch Break: 1:00 PM - 2:00 PMConsultation Duration: 30 minutesAvailable Slots:
9:00 AM, 9:30 AM, 10:00 AM, 10:30 AM, 11:00 AM, 
11:30 AM, 12:00 PM, 12:30 PM[Lunch Break]
2:00 PM, 2:30 PM, 3:00 PM, 3:30 PM, 4:00 PM, 4:30 PMFilter out:
- Already booked slots- Past time slots for today- Doctor leave dates
Estimated Wait Time

Current Time: 10:15 AMPatients in Queue: 3 patients before youAverage Consultation: 30 minutesCurrent Patient Started: 10:00 AMCalculation:
- Current patient remaining time: ~15 mins- Queue patients: 3 × 30 = 90 mins- Total wait time: 15 + 90 = 105 minutes ≈ 1 hour 45 mins- Your estimated time: 12:00 PM
Daily Revenue Calculation

Doctor 1: 15 patients × ₹500 = ₹7,500Doctor 2: 12 patients × ₹600 = ₹7,200Doctor 3: 8 patients × ₹700 = ₹5,600Additional Procedures: ₹2,200Total Revenue: ₹22,500Payment Mode Breakdown:
Cash: ₹15,000 (67%)
Card: ₹4,500 (20%)
UPI: ₹3,000 (13%)
Security & Compliance Considerations

Patient Data Privacy

Encrypt sensitive medical information
Implement proper access controls
Audit logs for who accessed patient records



Authentication Security

Strong password policies
Secure password hashing (bcrypt)
Session timeout for inactive users



Data Validation

Validate all inputs (phone numbers, dates, medical data)
Prevent SQL injection through ORM
Sanitize user inputs



Medical Record Integrity

Prescriptions and consultations should be append-only
Track all modifications with timestamp and user
Prevent unauthorized deletion of records





Optional Enhancements (If Time Permits)

SMS/Email integration for real-time notifications
Video consultation support (telemedicine)
Lab test integration and report management
Medicine inventory management (if clinic has pharmacy)
Insurance claim generation



Patient feedback and ratings
Multi-clinic support for chain clinics
Referral doctor management
Appointment waiting list for fully booked slots
Automatic follow-up scheduling based on prescription duration


Development Timeline Suggestion (2 Weeks)

Week 1

Days 1-2: Database design, backend setup, authentication
Days 3-4: Patient & doctor management, appointment booking logic
Days 5-7: Web frontend - registration, scheduling, dashboards


Week 2

Days 8-9: Consultation module, prescription & billing
Days 10-11: Mobile app development, PDF generation
Days 12-13: Queue management, reports, Docker setup
Day 14: Testing, bug fixes, documentation


Success Metrics

A successful implementation should demonstrate:

Complete patient journey from registration to prescription
Accurate appointment scheduling without conflicts
Clean separation of concerns in code
Responsive web interface for clinic staff
Functional mobile app for patients
PDF generation for prescriptions and bills
Role-based access working correctly
One-command Docker deployment
Comprehensive documentation
No critical bugs in appointment booking logic


Sample Test Scenarios

Double Booking Prevention

Two receptionists try to book same slot simultaneously






System should prevent and show error to second user



Doctor Schedule Validation

Try booking appointment on doctor's leave date
System should show "Doctor not available"



Queue Management

Check-in 5 patients for same doctor
Verify queue order and estimated wait time



Prescription History

Create multiple consultations for same patient
Doctor should see complete history during new visit



Payment Recording

Record partial payment for bill
Verify outstanding amount calculation
Complete payment and verify receipt generation



Mobile App Booking

Patient books appointment via mobile app
Verify it appears in receptionist's web dashboard immediately





Note to Students: This is a realistic clinic management scenario. Focus on building smooth workflows for the core features (registration, appointment booking, consultation, billing). Ensure appointment slot calculation is accurate as this is critical for the business. Prioritize user experience -
clinic staff will use this system hundreds of times daily, so make it efficient and intuitive.
